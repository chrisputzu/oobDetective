Project Title: Python Object Detection using OpenCV and TensorFlow Lite Interpreter

Description:
This project is an implementation of object detection in Python, leveraging the power of OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) and TensorFlow Lite Interpreter. Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and locating objects within an image or video. In this repository, we provide a Python script that utilizes pre-trained models from TensorFlow Lite to perform real-time object detection. The TensorFlow Lite Interpreter is used for efficient inference on embedded devices. Additionally, the project utilizes a file named 'coco_labels.txt' which contains the labels (classes) used for object detection.

Key Features:

Utilizes OpenCV for image processing and manipulation.
Integrates TensorFlow Lite Interpreter for efficient inference on embedded devices.
Implements object detection using pre-trained models, enabling real-time performance.
Provides a straightforward Python script for easy integration and usage.
Offers flexibility for customizing and fine-tuning detection parameters.
Dependencies:

OpenCV: Open Source Computer Vision Library for image processing tasks.
TensorFlow Lite Interpreter: Lightweight TensorFlow runtime designed for mobile and edge devices.
Python 3.x: Programming language used for scripting and development.
Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure all dependencies are installed using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Python script object_detection.py.
Optionally, modify the script to adjust detection parameters or use custom models.
