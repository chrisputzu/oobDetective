# oobDetective
This project is an implementation of object detection in Python, leveraging the power of OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) and TensorFlow Lite Interpreter. Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and locating objects within an image or video. In this repository, we provide a Python script that utilizes pre-trained models from TensorFlow Lite to perform real-time object detection.
